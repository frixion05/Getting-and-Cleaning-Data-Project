## Synopsis
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Project requirements
Required to submit are the following: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md, and
4) an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following should be created.   
   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.   
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.   
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
   5. From the data set in step iv, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

A `README.md` in the repo with the scripts should also be included. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

## Files
* `CodeBook.md` describes the data set and the analysis performed.  
* `run_analysis.R` is the script used to perform the analysis (the tasks needed in Project requirements #4). 
* `TidyData.txt` is the product of the analysis performed.
